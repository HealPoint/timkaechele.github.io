It was definitely about time to finally finish a project I started nearly one
year ago. I talk about the "Bookmark Liberation" (formerly known as KirbyZoo) a
lot has changed since I started with the initial project. I started with the
idea to write it completely in Kirby, which was a daunting task, due to the
relation mapping between bookmarks and all the nitty gritty things that are
helpful in the context of a cms, but are somehow not very useful outside of that
context. So I looked around and I saw all these little micro framework, that
imitate Ruby's brilliant Sinatra, but without all the elegance and style of a
true Sinatra. So last month I saw this awesome litte Library that Bastian wrote
called exactly that Library. It is really nothing more than a nice filesystem
abstraction with some sqlite sugar to speed up queries. It was exactly what I
always wanted. Lightweight, without heavy config files or setup and the best of
all really easy to use.
